                    <p>A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring or coloring food.
                        Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for flavoring or as a garnish.
                        Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production.
                        A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried.
                        Spices may be ground into a powder for convenience.
                        A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis.
                        India contributes to 75% of global spice production.</p>

                    <p> A crop is a plant that can be grown and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence.
                        Crops are typically divided into six categories: food crops, feed crops, fiber crops, oil crops, ornamental crops, and industrial crops.
                        When the plants of the same kind are cultivated at one place on a large scale, it is called a crop.
                        Most crops are cultivated in agriculture or hydroponics.Most crops are harvested as food for humans or fodder for livestock.
                        Some crops are gathered from the wild often in a form of intensive gathering.
                        Important non-food crops include horticulture, floriculture and industrial crops.</p></div>

                    <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food.
                        The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.
                        An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition.
                        It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
                        Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber.</p>

                    <p>Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds.
                        Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
                        In common language usage, fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries.

                    <p>Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.
                        Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat.
                        It is edible raw but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways.
                        Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with, and decomposition by, bacteria and fungi.
                        Meat is important to the food industry, economies, and cultures around the world.
                        Farmed animals are artificially selected for production parameters which sometimes impinge on the animals' welfare. For example, broiler chickens are bred to be very large to produce the greatest quantity of meat per animal.</p>

                    <p>An animal product is any material derived from the body of an animal.Examples are fat, flesh, blood, milk, eggs, and lesser known products, such as isinglass and rennet.
                        Animal by-products, as defined by the USDA, are products harvested or manufactured from livestock other than muscle meat.
                        The sale of animal by-products allows the meat industry to compete economically with industries selling sources of vegetable protein.
